A GTK3/2/Unity theme for **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Gnome 3.10**


**Original theme & credit:** [Flatts](http://nale12.deviantart.com/#/art/Flatts-09022014-432924057?hf=1)

Window buttons/Unity launcher customization [Numix]()

######the mod


- Colorscheme customizations to gtk2, gtk3, and Unity
- Workaround a bug that clashes with overlay scrollbars, drawing black backgrounds in tabbed Nautilus and Gedit windows, and in some Ubuntu dialogues
- Nautilus specific changes, to buttons, linked buttons, insensitive sidebar style; Unity window decorations changes
- gtk2 apps now draw from a simple gtkrc; the theme is still WIP mostly because I really want to make that perfect :)

The theme uses a light panel by default. To use a dark panel, go to the gtk-3.0 directory, and uncomment this line in the  gtk.css file
`@import url("unity-dark.css")`
commenting out at the same time this one
`@import url("unity.css")`

Save and reload your theme. 

Confusingly, Polar Day is not the light version of [Polar Night](https://github.com/baurigae/polar-night) - though it is an iteration :)
